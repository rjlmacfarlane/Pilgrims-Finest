        <p className="text-3xl">Pilgrim's Finest is the creation of Jessica Pilgrim. She is the founder, owner, and operator of Pilgrim's Finest Homemade Bread. The business is named for her late father, Clayton Pilgrim, who raised her in foster care and adopted her as an adult shortly before his passing. After receiving such a wonderful gift from her adoptive father, Jessica wanted to give something back to the community in his name. Inside her Paradise, Newfoundland kitchen, Jessica poured herself into creating not only traditional white and whole wheat bread, but also specialty loaves such as Honey Oat, Italian Herb &amp Cheddar Focaccia, Authentic Sourdough, Chocolate &amp Cinnamon Babka, and other varieties.

        <p className="text-3xl">
        Jessica's loaves were an instant hit. Friends and family couldn't get enough! Before long, Pilgrim's Finest Homemade Bread found a new home in Nova Scotia, Canada, where it is locally and lovingly crafted by hand, one loaf at a time.
